## Test a Perceptual Phenomenon
This is a project which is a part of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree program.

### Project Overview
The presented project is to investigate a classic phenomenon from experimental psychology called the Stroop Effect. It is to learn a little bit about the experiment, create a hypothesis regarding the outcome of the task, then go through the task. It takes look at some data collected from others who have performed the same task and computes some statistics describing the results. Finally, it interpret results in terms of hypotheses.

### Project Data
The dataset is provided by udacity which can be found [here](https://github.com/yashtanna93/Udacity_Data-Analyst-NanoDegree_Project1_Test-A-Perceptual-Phenomenon/blob/master/stroopdata.csv). Each row of the dataset contains the performance for one participant, with the first number their results on the congruent task and the second number their performance on the incongruent task.
